Stuff to do

1. Primary task

Binary classifier
- Solve ~5 most important features
- Solve which models which might be best for the task
- Use few different models to select the on with best accuracy
- (Divide events and nonevent data in 50/50 proportion to train and test data)
- (Test different train/test proportions)

2. Secondary task

Predict exact classes (Ia,Ib,II, nonevent)
- Use PCA to solve most important features
- K-means for clustering
- Hierarchical clustering r
- (Test different train/test proportions)

3. Sharing results

- Format model output for 'answers.csv' to pass the 'check.R' test.
- Write short pdf for the preliminary report (DL 6.12.)
- Finnish and polish the report to be returned 20.12.


All of us: Make the short (2 min) pitch for lecture 9.12. based on the preliminary report
